# MNIST-with-GAN

Generating MNIST_Digit and MNIST_Fashion Dataset using GAN model using Tensorflow and Keras. The loss fucntion and optimizer is defined in the code no predefined function is used , they can be changed accordingly.Weights and bias are also defined in the code and they can vary according to the dataset used.

Code for generating MNIST_Digit Dataset:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P9xcGB7unuNfg4WpLmY-BNXT0dbdKdkG)

Code for generating MNIST_Fashion Dataset:

Run the code for 5-10 epochs to check the output then run the code for 1000 epochs to get the exact same dataset which we want to generate.

Run the .py file on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
